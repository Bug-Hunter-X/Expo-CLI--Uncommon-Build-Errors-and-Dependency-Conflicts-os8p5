This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has incorrect or conflicting dependencies, especially those related to React Native and native modules.  It can manifest in various ways, from unexpected crashes during development to build failures. A common scenario involves a mismatch between the versions of React Native, Expo SDK, and third-party libraries. Incorrectly configured EAS Build configurations can also trigger this error.
